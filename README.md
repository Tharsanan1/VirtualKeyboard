# VirtualKeyboard
People within the modern times are busy with serious workloads and that
they don't have even one second to waste. They struggle to cut back their
everyday work by using standard computing devices like Desktop
Computers and Laptops, in addition more advanced devices like mobile
devices and PCs. To improve the movability and quality individuals tend to
cut back the dimensions of the devices. Thus, most of the mobile devices
and hand-held devices contain really small keypads. A number of the
individuals who use such a tool find it tough to see the letters on the
keyboard. With a mobile device, a full-size physical keyboard isn’t ideal.
But alternatives are available in the form of written recognition, speech
recognition etc. however all of them lack the accuracy and convenience of a
full-size keyboard. Here I have done a virtual keyboard to beat the above-
mentioned issues, which might be a viable replacement for fold-up
keyboards.
A virtual keyboard is a form factor of the keyboard delivered logically
through a software interface. The virtual keyboard is initially designed to
provide an on-screen instance of the keyboard for users with disabilities or a
malfunctioning physical keyboard. User simply point the visible keys.
It is used as an alternative to a traditional keyboard and can be accessed
through various interfaces. A virtual keyboard may also be called an on-
screen keyboard or soft keyboard.
